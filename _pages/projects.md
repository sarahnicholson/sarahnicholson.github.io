### Oxygen and biogeochemical dynamics along the west African margin: Processes and consequences (WAM)
WAM is a [Schmidt Sciences](https://www.schmidtsciences.org/) funded project, which falls under Schmidt Science’s new initiative, the Ocean Biogeochemistry Virtual Institute (OBVI). The West African ocean margin is a highly productive zone, critical for supporting key fisheries and marine diversity. It is also characterised by extensive oxygen-poor regions making it particularly susceptible to future environmental changes such as deoxygenation, which could have major socio-economic consequences for several West African countries. Yet, the future of ocean oxygenation and productivity is highly uncertain, in part because of the array of processes involved, ranging from global-scale atmospheric circulation to fine-scale (1-10 km) complex coastal currents. WAM aims to determine the inter-related controls on oxygen and productivity along the west African margin, from the tip of South Africa to the equator, and to identify implications for natural resources. This margin hosts several socioeconomically important ecosystems characterized by different oxygen conditions and levels of productivity. The project seeks to identify the organizing principles underlying the margin’s oxygen dynamics in order to develop predictive capacity for the region, with regard to oxygen and productivity and to the biogeochemical and ecosystem-level implications of changes in these parameters.

### Southern Ocean Carbon-Heat Nexus: mixed-layer processes & feedbacks for improved climate projections
The contemporary Southern Ocean regulates global climate by slowing down rates of anthropogenic warming through its globally disproportionate role in the uptake of excess heat and CO2 emissions (‘negative feedback’). Simultaneously, the Southern Ocean is warming, which hampers its ability to continue to absorb CO2 (‘positive feedback’). The role of the ocean in the uptake of heat and CO2 and these related feedbacks is termed the ‘ocean carbon–heat nexus’. Currently we do not adequately understand the processes behind this nexus but it is critical for predicting future climate and how the Southern Oceans' role as a buffer for climate change will evolve regionally and globally with different emission scenarios. The challenge lies in understanding, observing and modelling the multiple-cross-scale (e.g. 1 mm - 100 km) processes acting across the atmosphere-ocean and ocean mixed-layer interfaces that dictate the ocean's ability to take up excess heat and CO2. This proposal uses high-resolution observations, data-based reconstructions and models, to closely examine CO2 and heat flux together with a focus on sub-grid scale processes (not resolved in climate models). The two main aims of the proposal are to examine i) the drivers of ocean heat and CO2 fluxes and their feedbacks; and ii) to determine the importance of sub-grid scale process towards understanding interannual to decadal variability and feedbacks of CO2 and heat flux in the Southern Ocean.  Overall, this project aims to bring the study of heat and carbon together to improve our understanding and projection of carbon-climate feedbacks.


## Past projects

### Contemporary and Future Drivers of CO2 and Heat in the Southern Ocean 
#### PI: S.-A. Nicholson; co-PI: P.M.S Monteiro,  S. Swart
The contemporary Southern Ocean mitigates the effects of anthropogenic climate change through its disproportional uptake of carbon and heat. However, it is not well understood how this role will evolve under different emission and mitigation scenarios. The Southern Ocean also remains the largest source of global ocean uncertainty in the global estimates of CO2 and heat fluxes. While much has been achieved globally and regionally in constraining the variability and some of the mechanisms that drive Southern Ocean CO2 and heat fluxes separately, we propose that a significant part of the challenge lies in the lack of research on CO2 and heat together to better understand the feedback and the mechanisms that drive those feedbacks. This project aims to examine the changing role of the Southern Ocean in global climate by looking at the two main drivers CO2 and heat, in an integrated way using an unprecedented 10-year high resolution glider dataset from the 2012-2022 SOSCEx experiments, including two new experiments planned for this proposal, in combination with an established eddy resolving model BIOPERIANT12. We aim to gain a better understanding of how the interaction of atmospheric synoptic cycles (storms) and fine-scale (0.1-100 km) ocean processes influence seasonal-decadal variability of CO2 and heat fluxes. This will include the extent to which they feedback on each other and ultimately contribute to a better understanding of the role of the Southern Ocean in the global carbon-climate system. The expected three outcomes are 1. Improved observational constraints for the contemporary seasonal-interannual variability of CO2 and heat fluxes. 2. Understanding of how storms and their interaction with fine-scale dynamics influence the seasonal and interannual variability of CO2 and heat fluxes. 3. Identify the potential mechanisms that could explain the decadal anomaly in CO2 fluxes at the end of the 20th century.

### Southern Ocean Carbon and Heat Impact on Climate  (SO-CHIC)
#### PI: J.B. Sallee
The overall objective of SO-CHIC is to understand and quantify variability of heat and carbon budgets in the Southern Ocean through an investigation of the key processes controlling exchanges between the atmosphere, ocean and sea ice using a combination of observational and modelling approaches. SO-CHIC considers the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean as a natural laboratory both because of its worldwide importance in water-mass formation and because of the strong European presence in this sector already established at national levels, which allow to best leverage existing expertise, infrastructure, and observation network, around one single coordinated overall objective. SO-CHIC also takes the opportunity of the recent re-appearance of the Atlantic Sector Weddell Polynya to unveil its dynamics and global impact on heat and carbon cycles. A combination of dedicated observation, existing decades- long time-series, and state-of-the-art modelling will be used to address specific objectives on key processes, as well as their impact and feedback on the large-scale atmosphere-ocean system.

### The Ocean Beneath Antarctic Sea-ice: observing new scales to address a global challenge 
#### PI (Sweden): S. Swart; PI (South Africa): S. Thomalla & S. Nicholson

The Antarctic sea-ice covered ocean remains one of the least observed systems on the planet and has been severely under investigated in climate research. It is arguably the largest ‘blind spot’ of current global ocean-climate research. Through an innovative, coordinated and multidisciplinary approach, Sweden and South Africa will conduct novel autonomous ocean glider observations in the Antarctic marginal ice zone (MIZ). This partnership is extremely timely due to the availability of new technological capabilities for under ice observations, current government research strategy and access to the remote field sites. This project is to support exchange and collaborations between Sweden and South Africa.

### The role of storms in shaping upper ocean physics and primary production in the Southern Ocean 
#### PI: S.-A. Nicholson; co-PI: P.M.S Monteiro,  S. Swart
Beneath passing Southern Ocean storms, the ocean is characterized high eddy kinetic energy (eddies and fronts). The passage of intense storms over this underlying meso to sub­mesoscale eddy variability may strongly impact the upper­ ocean environment where phytoplankton live, yet exactly how remains unclear. This project plans for the first time to address this important climate knowledge gap by showing how these intense storms impact upper ocean physics and biogeochemistry with unique observations and modeling. Novel twinned autonomous ocean robots experiments have been designed to directly observe scale sensitivities and links between storm driven wind forcing, upper­ ocean mixing and phytoplankton growth. Several numerical models (idealised and regional) have been setup to (a) understand further the associated storm­driven mechanisms and (b) explore how changes in storm characteristics could impact annual primary production in the SO. Given that the SO is arguably the main source of medium­term uncertainty in global CO2 fluxes, understanding such climate sensitivities is of critical importance.
