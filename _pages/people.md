## People who I currently work with and alumni

### PhD Students

#### Isabelle Giddy (2018–2022, UCT & University of Gothenburg) Complete
_Giddy completed her PhD in 2022 through a joint program between the University of Cape Town, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), and the University of Gothenburg. Her doctoral research focused on upper ocean turbulence in the Weddell Gyre, particularly examining submesoscale flows in ice-impacted regions of the Southern Ocean._

#### Tesha Toolsee (2022–2025, University of Cape Town)
_Tesha is a PhD candidate from Mauritius working under the supervision of Dr Sarah-Anne Nicholson and Dr Pedro Monteiro. She is investigating the synoptic-scale coupled mixed layer and atmospheric dynamics of the carbon flux in the Southern Ocean using high-resolution Wave Gliders and regional numerical model output._

#### Tasha Smith (2019–2025, University of the Witwatersrand)
_Tasha Smith completed her BSc and MSc in Civil Engineering at the University of KwaZulu-Natal. Tasha joined SOCCO in 2019. She is a PhD candidate at the University of the Witwatersrand supervised by Prof. Pedro Monteiro, Dr. Sarah Nicholson and Prof. Francois Engelbrecht. Her PhD research focuses on mesoscale eddies in the South Atlantic region of the Southern Ocean and their influence on heat and CO2. Mesoscale eddies are not fully resolved or adequately parameterized in current Earth System Models, contributing to uncertainties in air-sea fluxes in current and future projections. This study is conducted using an eddy-resolving high resolution physical-biogeochemical ocean model, assessing the influence of eddies across the mesoscale spectrum on heat and CO2 fluxes and storage. It also looks at the eddy variability in these metrics over different regions, seasons, and eddy life cycle conditions._

#### Zakiena Hoossen (2019–present, University of the Witwatersrand)
_Zakiena has obtained an MSc in Mathematical Sciences from the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS) and UCT. Her background is in mathematics, physics, and recently machine learning. She currently combines these disciplines in her Ph.D. which focuses on the exchange of carbon and heat flux which occurs between the atmosphere and the upper ocean. In particular, her research tries to elucidate the impact/relationship of atmospheric forcing on the mixed layer on a sub-grid scale level through numerical modelling and Machine Learning (ML). The domain of interest being the Southern Ocean (SO) as it is particularly important in driving large-scale heat and CO2 uptake._

#### Vusani Mikosi (2025–present, University of Cape Town)
_Vusani Mikosi is an MSc Physics graduate from the University of Limpopo. She joined SOCCO in 2025 as a PhD student intern, working under the WAM (West African Margin) project. Her research focuses on understanding fine-scale physical and biogeochemical processes driving oxygen variability along the West African Margin using high-resolution data collected from ocean gliders._
