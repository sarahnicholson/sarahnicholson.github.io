### Tasha Smith (2019–2025, University of the Witwatersrand) 
_Tasha Smith completed her BSc and MSc in Civil Engineering at the University of KwaZulu-Natal. Tasha joined SOCCO in 2019. She is a PhD candidate at the University of the Witwatersrand supervised by Prof. Pedro Monteiro, Dr. Sarah Nicholson and Prof. Francois Engelbrecht. Her PhD research focuses on mesoscale eddies in the South Atlantic region of the Southern Ocean and their influence on heat and CO2. Mesoscale eddies are not fully resolved or adequately parameterized in current Earth System Models, contributing to uncertainties in air-sea fluxes in current and future projections. This study is conducted using an eddy-resolving high resolution physical-biogeochemical ocean model, assessing the influence of eddies across the mesoscale spectrum on heat and CO2 fluxes and storage. It also looks at the eddy variability in these metrics over different regions, seasons, and eddy life cycle conditions._

### Zakiena Hoossen (2019–present, University of the Witwatersrand)
_Zakiena has obtained an MSc in Mathematical Sciences from the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS) and UCT. Her background is in mathematics, physics, and recently machine learning. She currently combines these disciplines in her Ph.D. which focuses on the exchange of carbon and heat flux which occurs between the atmosphere and the upper ocean. In particular, her research tries to elucidate the impact/relationship of atmospheric forcing on the mixed layer on a sub-grid scale level through numerical modelling and Machine Learning (ML). The domain of interest being the Southern Ocean (SO) as it is particularly important in driving large-scale heat and CO2 uptake._

### Vusani Mikosi (2025–present, University of Cape Town)
_Vusani Mikosi is an MSc Physics graduate from the University of Limpopo. She joined SOCCO in 2025 as a PhD student intern, working under the WAM (West African Margin) project. Her research focuses on understanding fine-scale physical and biogeochemical processes driving oxygen variability along the West African Margin using high-resolution data collected from ocean gliders._

## MSc Students (present and former)

### Kevin Schmidt (2017)
_Developed and validated a novel glider-based method to estimate ocean surface fluxes._  
##### Associated publication
- **Evaluation of Satellite and Reanalysis Wind Products with In Situ Wave Glider Wind Observations in the Southern Ocean**  
  *Kevin M. Schmidt, Sebastiaan Swart, Chris Reason, Sarah-Anne Nicholson*  Kevins Thesis involved a comparison of multiple wind data products to high-resolution in situ wind measurements from Wave Glider deployments in the Southern Ocean to assess their accuracy in representing wind magnitude and variability. The ECMWF reanalysis best captured temporal variability, while NCEP–DOE AMIP-II most accurately represented mean wind states, highlighting the value of autonomous surface vehicles for validating wind datasets in data-sparse regions

### Ayanda Mpalweni (2019, University of Cape Town)
_Ayanda Mpalweni's 2019 master's thesis investigates how mid-latitude storms affect upper-ocean mixing in the Sub-Antarctic Zone, focusing on both the mixed layer depth (MLD) and the transitional layer depth (TLD). Utilizing high-resolution data from autonomous gliders, the study identifies two distinct storm response modes: one where the MLD deepens with minimal changes below, and another where significant changes occur in the TLD without MLD alteration. These findings highlight that relying solely on MLD as a proxy for storm-driven mixing may overlook critical subsurface dynamics, emphasizing the importance of considering the transitional layer in oceanographic models._

### Tumelo Comfort Moalusi (2019, University of Cape Town)
Tumelo Moalusi holds a BSc in Computer Science and Mathematics, followed by an Honours degree in Mathematical Science from North-West University. He subsequently pursued an MSc in Applied Ocean Science at the University of Cape Town, where his research focused on wind variability in the South Atlantic Sector of the Southern Ocean and its influence on the upper ocean within a numerical ocean model.

#### Johan Edholm (2020, University of Gothenburg, Distinction)
Johan thesis involved investigating the role atmospheric rivers play in adjusting surface buoyancy in the Southern Ocean. It showed that episodic atmospheric rivers (ARs) significantly impact surface buoyancy forcing during summer by delivering large pulses of freshwater and heat. These ARs increase upper-ocean stratification in the Atlantic Southern Ocean, suggesting they are an important, previously under-recognized driver of seasonal mixed-layer variability in this region.

### Bongiwe Jojo (2024, University of Cape Town)
Bongiwe's thesis investigates interannual variability in oceanic pCO₂ in the sea-ice-impacted Southern Ocean using in situ, satellite, and reanalysis data during austral summer from 2000 to 2018. It finds that non-thermal drivers—especially salinity—are the dominant controls on pCO₂ variability, with significant responses to sea-ice loss events like in 2016. The Southern Annular Mode does not consistently correlate with annual pCO₂ trends, though it may influence longer-term variability.

### Gonzalo Ruiz (2024-present, University of Gothenburg)
This thesis investigates small-scale (0.1–10 km) and short-term (1–10 days) drivers of CO₂ flux variability in the Cape Basin using high-resolution Wave Glider data. It finds that wind-driven gas transfer velocity (Kw) accounts for ~78% of flux variability, though mesoscale features can temporarily enhance the pCO₂ gradient (ΔpCO₂), making it the dominant driver during moderate winds. The results highlight that current reanalysis products miss this fine-scale variability, emphasizing the need for high-resolution observations to refine global carbon flux estimates.
