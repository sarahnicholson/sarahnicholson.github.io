# Community Involvement

I actively contribute to the international oceanographic community through service on several scientific panels and working groups. These roles reflect my commitment to advancing collaborative, interdisciplinary science focused on understanding ocean processes and their role in the climate system.

## Current Panels

### CLIVAR/CliC/SCAR Southern Ocean Region Panel (2023–present)
I serve as a member of the [Southern Ocean Region Panel (SORP)](https://www.clivar.org/clivar-panels/southern), a joint initiative of CLIVAR, CliC, and SCAR. The panel provides scientific guidance and coordination for research activities in the Southern Ocean, with a focus on understanding its role in the global climate system.

### SOFLUX Capability Working Group Leadership Team (2023–present)
I am part of the leadership team of [SOFLUX](https://soos.aq/activities/cwg/soflux), a Southern Ocean Observing System (SOOS) Capability Working Group. SOFLUX promotes coordinated air-sea flux observations in the Southern Ocean, aiming to improve quantification of momentum, heat, and gas exchange.

### SCOR Working Group 162: ATOMIX (2020–2025)
I am an associate member of [ATOMIX (Analysing Ocean Turbulence Observations to Quantify Mixing)](https://scor-int.org/group/analysing-ocean-turbulence-observations-to-quantify-mixing-atomix/), a SCOR Working Group dedicated to improving understanding and parameterization of ocean mixing.  
Key outputs from this group include:  
- [Frontiers in Marine Science: "A Multi-Institutional Compilation of Ocean Mixing Observations"](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/marine-science/articles/10.3389/fmars.2024.1334327/full)  
- [ATOMIX project Wiki](https://atomix.app.uib.no/Main_Page)

## Past Panels

### CLIVAR Ocean Model Development Panel (OMDP) – Co-Chair (2022–2023)
I served as Co-Chair of the [CLIVAR Ocean Model Development Panel](https://www.clivar.org/clivar-panels/omdp), which supports international coordination and advancement of ocean model development. The panel provides a forum for exchange between modelling centres, observationalists, and theorists to improve ocean model performance and representation of key processes.
